# Tic-tac-toe
A game of tic-tac-toe using python.

This game consists of three modes which are:
  1. Player versus Player
  2. Player versus AI(with random choice that is easy mode.)
  3. Player versus AI(with best choice that is difficult mode.)

Keyboard shortcuts for the game:
  1. q for quit.
  2. r for reset.
  3. g for changing from pvp to ai mode. Default mode: pvp.
  4. 0 for changing ai level to easy(random).
  5. 1 for changing ai level to difficult(best choice).

Minimax algorithm was implemented to code the difficult AI mode. Hope you would enjoy the game.
