# Tic-tac-toe
A game of tic-tac-toe using python.

This game consists of three modes which are:
  1. Player versus Player
  2. Player versus AI(with random choice that is easy mode.)
  3. Player versus AI(with best choice that is difficult mode.)

Minimax algorithm was implemented to code the difficult AI mode. Hope you would enjoy the game.
